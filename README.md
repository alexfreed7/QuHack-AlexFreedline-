Generate music with a quantum computer!

## Installation

`brew install fluidsynth`

## Abstract

The creation of good music has been a coveted talent for centuries. Making a good song is quite difficult as one must know all the notes and which notes to play after the other in order to produce a 'banger'. As a society we have long relied on talented people to bring us the joy of music. We however, have challenged those individuals by successfully writing an algorithm that creates music while minimizing the dissonance between the notes. Using the D-wave Leap IDE we applied the rules of music theory to a Markov Network in order to optimize the quality of the music and minimize the dissonance from one chord to another. Furthermore we translated the raw music we created into a playable mp3 form for all to experience quantum music.

## Goals

Our primary goal was to use quantum computing to create something amazing. We decided on music because we had not heard of anyone using quantum annealing to optimize the creation of music.
